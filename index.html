			<h1 class="heading">History of Tucker Pet Paradise</h1>
				<p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all started with a young man who has passion 
				and love for his pet. The name of the man was Simson Ng. The passion of his started 
				when he first gotten his pet dog name Tucker in his early adulthood. As time passed 
				the relation between Simson and Tucker became closer. Simson treated Tucker as he is 
				one of his family members. Never the less he gave the best that he can to let Tucker 
				live a happy life. Unfortunately, Tucker passed away due to illness. Simson was sad 
				that as he could only let Tucker go. From that day onwards, he promised to provide 
				the best service to any pet in the world. That was when he started his own pet service 
				center in KL. It was named after his pet Tucker and was called Tucker Pet Paradise.</p>
				
				<p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tucker Pet Paradise was started in 1991. 
				It was the first pet center that provides all types of services and facilities in Asia.
				Simson got this idea during his studies abroad in United States. He notices that the western 
				were able to provide the best lifestyle for their pets. Therefore, Simson started to invest 
				his time and money to achieve his promise. It was after his first center was ready to open 
				and even the day before the opening day, the center had already created a stir. Everyone was 
				so excited for the center to open. Without failing the first day when the center opened, 
				reservations were all fully booked. It was a great success for Simson as all his hard work and 
				love for Tucker were not wasted.</p>
